//! Cpuid vmexit controller.
//!
//! The cpuid instruction is a special instruction in x86 processors, used to obtain information about the processor and its features.
//! When executed, the instruction returns data in the processor's registers, including the vendor, model number, and feature flags.
//!
//! The cpuid instruction takes one input argument (leaf) in the EAX register, which determines the type of information to retrieve.
//! Different input values provide different information.
//! For example, setting EAX to 0 returns a 12-character ASCII string representing the CPU manufacturer ID in EBX, EDX, and ECX registers,
//! with "GenuineIntel" being the string for Intel processors.
//!
//! A guest operating system cannot execute the Cpuid instruction directly, instead causing a VM exit to the host, which must handle the instruction.
//! This part aims to emulate the cpuid instruction in the guest by executing the instruction on the host side.
//! However, not all the result could be forwarded. For example, when the host executes the Cpuid instruction with EAX = 1,
//! the result contains the executing core's CPU ID, not the VCPU ID. In this case, the result needs to modified to contain the VCPU ID.
//!
//! ## Tasks
//! Implement cpuid controller's handle method to emulate cpuid instruction.
//! If the input to the instruction is EAX = 1, you must carefully handle the cpuid. Because it holds the cpu id of the current logical processor not virtual cpu id.
//! It may be helpful to understand [how to obtain the CPU ID of the executing core.](/src/abyss/x86_64/intrinsics.rs.html)
//! In addition, you **MUST** forward the vCPU instruction pointer (rip) to prevent it from executing the same instructions indefinitely.
