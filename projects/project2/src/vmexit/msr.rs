//! Model-specific register vmexit controller.
//!
//! x86 processors include a collection of specialized registers that permit the customization of CPU capabilities.
//! Each register possesses a 64-bit space, and accessing these registers necessitates using `rdmsr` (read) or `wrmsr` (write) instructions.
//!
//! The `rdmsr` instruction reads a register that is determined by the index value provided in the ECX register.
//! The retrieved MSR value is stored in the EDX and EAX registers, with the high-order 32 bits of the MSR value placed in the EDX register,
//! and the low-order 32 bits placed in the EAX register. In 64-bit architectures, the high-order 32 bits of both the RDX and RAX registers are set to 0.
//!
//! The `wrmsr` instruction writes a value to a register specified in the ECX register as an index.
//! The value written to the MSR is obtained from the EDX and EAX registers.
//! Specifically, the value in EDX is written to MSR\[63:32\] (high-order 32bits), and the value in EAX is written to MSR\[31:0\] (low-order 32bits).
//!
//! When managing virtual machines, the default behavior is for the host to intercept `rdmsr`/`wrmsr` instructions from the guest.
//! Therefore, the host needs to emulate these MSR access requests.
//!
//! ## Tasks
//! In this part, you requires to write a manager to maintain the msr. When configuring the VCpu, the msr handlers are registered via [`Controller::insert`].
//! After that, when the guest operating system is trapped back to the VMM by executing either `rdmsr` or `wrmsr`, the control passed to the
//! [`Controller::handle`]. In the function, the handler finds the corresponding msr handlers, runs the handler and reflect the result into the VCpu state.
//! Again, you **MUST** forward the vCPU instruction pointer (rip) to prevent it from executing the same instructions infinitely.
